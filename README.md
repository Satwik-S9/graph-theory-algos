# Algorithms from Graph Theory

> This is a Repository containing all the standard and populart graph theory algorithms written in Python and C++ (some are in Java but I am not skilled in that language so expect slow progress).

- Inspired from @author [William Fiset's](https://github.com/williamfiset/algorithms) great course.
- Currently Hosting:
  
  - Breadth First Search (Iterative).
  - Breadth First Search Shortest Path Problem.
  - Depth First Search (Recursive and Iterative). 
  - Depth First Search Count the total number of nodes in the Graph (Recursive and Iterative).
